## For the AR(2) model given by $$x_t = -0.9x_{t-2} + w_t$$, find the roots of the autoregressive polynomial, and then plot the ACF, $\rho(h)$.

```{r}
z = c(1, 0.9) # coefficients of the polynomial
roots = Mod(polyroot(z))
roots

y = ARMAacf(ar=c(0,-0.9), ma=0, 100)
plot(y, type = "h", ylab = "ACF(2) model", xlab = "lag")
abline(h=0)
```
