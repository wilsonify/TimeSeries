Consider the luteinizing hormone (data(lh) from
library(datasets)) in blood samples at 10-min intervals from a human female, 48 samples. 

```R
library(datasets)
```

```R
plot(lh)
acf(lh,lag.max = "m")
```
Is the pattern of the ACF consitent
with a stationary AR model?

Yes. The acf of lh oscillates and decays to zero as lag increases. 

Simulate an AR(3) using n = 50 and the coefficients=c(0.64,-0.06,-0.22). 
Using the coefficients, is this a stationary AR(3)?

```R
coefficients <- c(0.64,-0.06,-0.22)
ar3 <- arima.sim(list(order=c(3,0,0),ar=coefficients),n=50)
```

```R
plot(ar3)
```

```R
z <- c(1,-coefficients)
Mod(polyroot(z))
```

this AR(3) is stationary because all roots of the characteristic polynomial have a magnitude > 1.

Compare the theoretical ACF with the ACF
of the luteinizing hormone data . Observations?


```R
acf(ar3,lag.max = "m")
```

```R
acf(lh,lag.max = "m")
```
