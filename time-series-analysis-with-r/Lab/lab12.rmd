Fit a seasonal ARIMA model of your choice to the chicken price data in chicken. 

Check the fit and use the estimated model to forecast the next 12 months.

```{r}
ts.plot(chicken)
```
From 2002 to 2016, chicken has been trending up, with some flucuations.

```{r}
acf2(chicken,max.lag = 50)[1]
```
acf trails off slowly. pacf cuts off immediately.

```{r}
dchicken <- diff(chicken)
acf2(dchicken,max.lag = 50)[1]
```

after differencing, the acf oscillates with a frequency of 12. pacf cuts off after 12.
This suggests that the seasonal parameter, s, is 12.
```{r}
sdchicken <- diff(chicken,12)
acf2(sdchicken,max.lag = 50)
```
after seasonal differencing, acf oscilates more slowly and decays slowly.
pacf cuts off after 1.

```{R}
sarima(chicken, 2,1,0, 1,0,0, 12)
```


```{R}
auto.arima(chicken)
```
