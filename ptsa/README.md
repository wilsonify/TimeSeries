# Code for Practical Time Series Analysis

Welcome. This git repository contains some (but not all) code that you will encounter in Practical Time Series Analysis. Over time this repository will expand to cover more of the material from the book and also to include extra examples.

Comments and corrections are welcome. Please either submit a pull request or contact me via email at author's first name [DOT] A (my middle initial) [DOT] author's last name at gmail.

I would also mention that much of the work on this book relates to earlier tutorials I have given. I link below to some YouTube videos showing these tutorials.
