## Use two different smoothing techniques described in Section 2.3 to estimate the trend in the global temperature series globtemp. Comment.

```{r}
library(astsa)
plot(globtemp)
lines(lowess(globtemp), lwd=2, col=4) # lowess method
lines(lowess(globtemp), lty=2, lwd=2, col=2)
```

```{r}
plot(globtemp)
  lines(smooth.spline(time(globtemp), globtemp), lwd=2, col=4) # Smoothing Splines method
  lines(smooth.spline(time(globtemp), globtemp), lty=2, lwd=2, col=2)
```

# The two smoothing techniques used Lowess and Smoothing Splines came out to be almost similar. Both plots show an upward trend. There is a drop in temperature between 1900-1920 and a significant spike in temperature in the 1940s.
