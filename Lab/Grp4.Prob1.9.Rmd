### 1.9 A time series with a periodic component can be constructed from 
$$x_t = U_1 sin(2 \pi \omega_0 t) + U_2 cos(2 \pi \omega_0 t)$$

### where U1 and U2 are independent random variables with zero means and 
$$E(U_1^2) = E(U_1^2) = \sigma^2$$ 

### The constant $\omega_0$ determines the period or time it takes the process to make one complete cycle. Show that this series is weakly stationary with autocovariance function
$$\gamma (h) = \sigma^2 cos(2 \pi \omega_0 h)$$
```{r}
U1 <- rnorm(100,0,1)
U2 <- rnorm(100,0,1)
omega_0 <- 1/50
xt <- U1*sin(2*pi*omega_0*1:100) + U2*cos(2*pi*omega_0*1:100) # t = 1:100
acf(xt, type = "covariance")
```

# From the plot we can conclude this series is weakly stationary, because after Lag0, subsequent Lags die out quickly.
