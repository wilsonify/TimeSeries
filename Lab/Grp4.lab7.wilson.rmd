# 1. Simulate an MA(3). Is it invertible? What do you notice about the pattern of the ACF?

```{R}
ma3 <- arima.sim(list(order=c(0,0,3), ma= rep(0.9,3)), n=100)
acf(ma3)
```
acf shows non-stationarity at lag = 1, 2, and 3
    
# 2. Analyze the percentage changes in quarterly personal disposable income for the US, 1970 to 2010. What model can you propose?

```{R}
library(fpp)
income <- ts(usconsumption[, 'income'],start=1970,frequency = 4)
ts.plot(income)
acf(income)

dincome <- diff(income)
ts.plot(dincome)
acf(dincome)
```
quarterly personal disposable income for the US, 1970 to 2010 is stationary. It can be modeled as a random walk.
changes in quarterly personal disposable income for the US, 1970 to 2010 are non-stationary at lag=1. It can be modeled as a moving average(1).
