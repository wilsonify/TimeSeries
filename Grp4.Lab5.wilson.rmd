```{R}
library(data.table)
```

## Generate a simple random walk data.

```{R}
w_t <- ts(rnorm(500,0,1))
plot(w_t)
acf(w_t)
```


### Apply first-order differencing.

```{R}
dw_t <- diff(w_t)
plot(dw_t)
acf(dw_t)
```
#### Did it remove non-stationarity? 
*no* it adds non-stationartiy at lag=1.

### Apply second-order differencing.
```{R}
ddw_t <- diff(dw_t)
plot(ddw_t)
acf(ddw_t)
```

#### Did it remove non-stationarity? 
*No* it intoduces non-stationarity at lag=2

## Consider the immigration data from BB. 

```{R}
immigration_data = fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonify/TimeSeries/master/data/immigration.csv')
```


```{R}
plot(immigration_data$yr,immigration_data$count)
acf(immigration_data$count)
```

### Stationary? 
No

### If not stationary then try to stationarize the data.

```{R}
dcount <- diff(immigration_data$count)
acf(dcount)
```

Consider the Monthly Australian Beer Consumption data from BB.

Decompose the data and interpret.


```{R}
beer_data = fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonify/TimeSeries/master/data/monthly-beer-production-in-austr.csv')
```

```{R}
colnames(beer_data) <- c('month','beer')
```

```{R}
beer <- ts(beer_data$beer, start = 1956 ,frequency = 12)
```

```{R}
decompose_beer <- decompose(beer,type="additive")
plot(decompose_beer)
```

Australian beer production shows a steady increase from 1960 to 1975 plateauing at 160 megaliters per month with consistent seasonal swings.
