**more than just data ...**  
... `astsa` is the R package to accompany the [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319524511) text, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/)  and the Chapman & Hall text  [Time Series A Data Analysis Approach using R](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsda/)... both by Shumway and Stoffer. 

*Feel free to contact the maintainer if you have a request. The requests we've had so far have taken only a few minutes to code - it's the nice thing about GitHub - updates are painless.*

The Springer text was written under version 1.8 and the Chapman & Hall text was written under version 1.8.8. Later versions will work for both texts with only some minor changes that won't affect any of the data analysis. 


We won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN, but the latest working version of the package will always be here.
 
* Version 1.12 on GitHub now and on CRAN by 2021 
* See the [News](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package and the changelog.
